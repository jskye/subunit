<h2>Subunit</h2>
<h4>Selections in THREE.js</h4>

A small library that gives you D3 style selections in THREE.js. Now you can do awesome stuff in WebGL with a familiar API. Subunit selects into a THREE.js scene graph just like selecting into the DOM with D3.

```html
npm install subunit
```

The library only has peer dependency on THREE.js.  D3 is not required to be loaded on the page.
